<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Jedi Knight Academy is an admittedly old game, but it still has a fair bt of populated ervers. Much of the comunities there also have a discord group. 

Hence, this project has the followin aims :
* Make a discord bot that can query a JKA server (My own need at first)
* Make it easy for others to deploy the same bot in their own communities
* Add potential for extending the functionality to include other features

This was started from my own need of being able to quickly see who is online in a server at a given time without having to start the game and log in.

### Built With
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [GameDig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gamedig)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This can be run locally, as well as hosted on a remote server. My recommendation is to use Heroku as it is free and easy-to-use.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed the following:
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
* Node
```sh
sudo apt get install node
```

### Installation

1. Create a Discord Bot by following [their own documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
2. Modify the main file (discordBotJka.js) to add the following parameters:
    * token - the secret token of your bot (Taken from the Discord Developer Portal)
    * server1IP - The IP of the server
    * server1Port - The port that the server is running on
    * channelName - The ID of the channel that you want the bot to post to (YOu can get this by turning on developer mode in your discord setting and right-clicking the channel)


3. Add the bot to your server

You might need 'Manage Server' Permissions so beware.

4. Open a terminal window inside the cloned repository folder and run the following command
```sh
node discordBotJka.js
```

5. (Optional) Upload to heroku and run the dyno that is included in the procfile


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this on a dicord server to access data about current players on a JKA server. There is more than just what's being displayed there, so feel free to take a look at the logs (It will log the whole retrieved object)
